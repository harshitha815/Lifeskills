## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
   It was very interesting to hear the story of pushups and how anchoring a new habit to an already-formed habit helped them.
## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
   M stands for motivation, A stands for ability, and P stands for prompt. We can start by finding the motivation to start the habit and 
   then start the habit on a small scale, and tie the habit to already-formed habits. In this way, we can use B=MAP to form new habits.
## Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
  * It will help us to stay motivated.
  * It will help us form habits that will help us in the long run
  * It will make the habit or work seem more fun.
# 1% Better Every Day Video 
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
   The story of how implementation intentions can increase the chance of our success in developing habits was interesting. The story is 
   about an exercise study and there were three cohorts in this study.
   * Control group - They only tracked how often they exercised.
   * Motivated group - They received motivational speeches about the benefits of exercise.
   * Implementation group - Along with the motivational speech they were asked to write down a plan.
     ### Results -
     * Control group - Only one out of three worked out.
     * Motivated group - Did not show much improvement despite all the motivational speeches.
     * Implementation group - Nine out of Ten worked out as they had an actual plan of how, when, and where they would exercise.
# Atomic Habits - 
## What is the book's perspective on Identity?
   When we solve problems in terms of outcomes we only solve them temporarily. But to solve problems in the longer term, at the 
   systems level, we need to change our identity. The book says that identity change is the North Star of habit change. It means instead 
   of focusing only on outcome the best way to build habits is to focus on identity.
